    <h1>2025 UK Fuel Costs: Electric vs. Petrol/Diesel</h1>

    <p>Are you really curious about saving money while switching to the electric car option? So let us compare electric vs petrol/diesel cars for better understanding of the cost difference and usefulness. Also you can check our tips to lower your fuel cost — you can <a href="https://myfuelcostchecker.netlify.app">visit this web page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Average Fuel Costs in 2025 (per 100 miles):</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Electric Vehicle (home charging):</strong> £5.80</li>
      <li><strong>Electric Vehicle (public charging):</strong> £11.20</li>
      <li><strong>Petrol Car:</strong> £14.70</li>
      <li><strong>Diesel Car:</strong> £13.60</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why EVs Are Cost-Effective</h2>
    <p>If you can charge your EV in off-peak hours this will save more money. Many suppliers now offer special EV tariffs that drop rates to as low as 8p per kWh at night. Even though public chargers are more expensive, the overall fuel cost for EVs remains lower in most scenarios.</p>
    <p>The cheapest way of charging your EVs is to charge them in off-peak hours. The public charger is more expensive but compared with the other diesel and fuel cost, in most scenarios EVs remain lower.</p>

    <h2>But What About the Vehicle Cost?</h2>
    <p>All the EVs have a higher upfront cost but the government grants 0% finance on vehicle cost and also maintenance of EVs are 30–40% cheaper.</p>

    <h2>Hidden Costs of Petrol/Diesel</h2>
    <p>The internal combustion costs more in context of servicing and maintenance. Also, road taxes and ULEZ charges are there in cities. So if you choose EVs then you don't need to spend this additional cost.</p>

    <h2>Charging Infrastructure in the UK 2025</h2>
    <p>The UK now has over 55,000 charging points, including ultra-fast chargers at most major service stations. Apps like Zap-Map make finding a nearby charger easy, even during road trips.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Switching to electricity may not be ideal for everyone. For rural drivers or those with long daily commutes, hybrids may be the best choice.</p>
