    <h2>1. Keep Your Tyres Properly Inflated</h2>
    <p>Always try to keep your tires properly inflated because it helps you to reduce your fuel costs. A report published by Tyresafe UK states that if you use underinflated tyres it will cost you 10% more than you normally spend on fuel. So better to give a few minutes of your time which can save you pounds over time.</p>

    <h2>2. Drive Smoothly and Steadily</h2>
    <p>While driving we also make some habitual mistakes like harsh braking and sudden acceleration. Research shows that If you can use your cruise control option and anticipate stops properly you can increase your mpg by 33% on motorways and 5% in town. So avoid aggressive driving and improve your driving skills by practicing anticipating stops.</p>

    <h2>3. Lighten the Load</h2>
    <p>Do you know that your car's roof racks and other unnecessary items like boxes are costing you every day by increasing fuel prices? Each 50 kg of additional weight that a car carries is responsible for cutting fuel economy by 1â€“2%.</p>

    <h2>4. Plan Efficient Routes</h2>
    <p>Plan your route before you head towards the journey. Idling in traffic consumes fuel unnecessarily so avoid traffic congestion by planning your route using Google Maps. In an urban setting you can previously predict which routes have more congestion than others so choose accordingly where you can avoid congestion. It can also cut your fuel usage by 20%.</p>

    <h2>5. Limit Air Conditioning Use</h2>
    <p>So in UK roads if you are driving under 50 mph by only opening your windows you can avoid using AC. Aircon increases your fuel usage so try to improve your habits by simply using this trick while driving.</p>

    <h2>6. Service Your Car Regularly</h2>
    <p>Always do proper servicing of your car in monthly intervals. Do you know a well-maintained engine runs more efficiently? Always use the right grade of motor oil, clean air filters, and proper spark plugs.</p>
