    <h2>Why Fuel Efficiency Matters in 2025</h2>
    <p>As you all know well, the commodity price of fuel fluctuates every day, and because it is non-renewable energy, the price will rise day by day, so we have to be more cautious about our vehicle fuel consumption. According to a recent survey in the UK, one driver can save about Â£200 annually. If you maintain the vehicle properly by tracking your day-to-day fuel consumption, you can do it easily.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do Here:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calculate MPG:</strong> Quickly find out how many miles per gallon your car is achieving using our MPG calculator. It's very user-friendly and comes with a clean design. You also clear the current result and put in other data for checking MPG.</li>
      <li><strong>Explore Expert Tips:</strong> Read up-to-date advice on how to increase your car's efficiency and reduce costs. All the data are updated to 2025 and taken from the latest surveys, research, or government announcements.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Learn about fuel trends and government updates like HMRC Advisory Fuel Rates. Fuel prices always fluctuate, so it is better to calculate each time; maybe the current result differs from the previous results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>You just need to enter the distance that you have driven in miles and the fuel you used in liters, and then our calculator will instantly give you accurate results about your MPG. Don't worry; our results are 100% accurate and updated to 2025 conversion rates. You can also find a clear button just below the calculate button, which helps you to clear the current result without refreshing the page.
